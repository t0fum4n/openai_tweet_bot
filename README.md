# openai_tweet_bot

This is a POC tweet bot using open AI

You will need to add your creds for both twiiter and the openai api in a config.py file in this format

ck = "Consumer key"
cs = "Consumer Secret Key"
at = "access token"
ats = "access token secret"
oik = "openai api key"


i made this after i figured out i could structre my prompt in a way that would return a tweet style response. 

the use case i am going to use this for is to ceeate tweets from the perspective of historical people.
